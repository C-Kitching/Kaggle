    "# ⚡🧊⚡[LB 1.183] Polar Lightning\n",
    "In this notebook, I cover a number of strategies and optimization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies:\n",
    "1. Dual time-weighted center of charge: A simple way to calculate best fit line using all 5 dimensions (x,y,z,time,charge): see Section 1. **LB 1.214**. Train Batch 1: 1.21728. <br>\n",
    " b. Similarly: SolverWorld discusses [here][1] and implements [here][2] a least squares algorithm using 4 dimensions (x,y,z,time): LB 1.214. Train Batch 1: 1.21724. <br>\n",
    " c. UPDATE: It turns out that this least squares formula is **exactly** equivalent to the time-weighted formula for #1, unweighted by 'charge'. After applying a weighted version of the least squares algorithm, it gets exactly the same results as my separately derived formula. I keep both variants in my notebook to summarize and compare. And the high-level description of each is very different, even though the formula ends up identical.\n",
    "2. Find best points: a baseline method for labeling auxiliary column ourselves. I first discussed this concept [here][3], and will explain more about this strategy in Section 2. **LB 1.184**. Train Batch 1: 1.18865.\n",
    "3. Ensemble of charge weighted and unweighted: **LB 1.183**. Train Batch 1: 1.18753.\n",
    "4. Small optimization on top of #2: use 1/100th weight for aux=False points not selected with 'best points' algorithm. **LB 1.182??**. Train Batch 1: 1.18623.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Techniques\n",
    "1. Avoid for loops or groupby-apply where possible. Gets the 1.214 baseline from around 1 hour to about 2 minutes, a 30x improvement. Note: All times are in terms of submitting and scoring a notebook against the full test dataset. Highlighted in Section 1.\n",
    "2. To optimize labeling auxiliary columns, use pure numpy with minimized input/output data size for the unfortunate 'for each event' part. Gets the 1.184 baseline from ~ an hour to about 8 minutes, a 6x improvement. Part of Section 2.\n",
    "3. Try using Polars instead of Pandas! This is my first time using it, please join me in exploring what it can do! See Section 3. Gets the 1.214 baseline from about 120 seconds to about 100 seconds, even with a 35 second pip install cost. So about 2x faster. No real improvement, though, on overall execution time when finding best points, still about 8 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Credits\n",
    "Thanks to many Kagglers who have shared ideas. I shamelessly stole the Notebook intro formatting from cdeotte - for example [here][4]. As credited above, SolverWorld for summarizing and highlighting the least squares algorithm, which I added for both comparison and for ensembling. And many people contributed to my understanding of the physics of IceCube neutrino detection.\n",

    "### Dual time-weighted Center of Charge in more detail\n",
    "The core concept is if the charge - the light - from the neutrino collision travels omni-directionally and also in the direction of the neutrino, then if we center all 'early' time events versus all 'late' time events, the spherical omni-directional attributes will, on average, cancel out, leaving only the directional attributes we are looking for. We could do a naive technique like first half vs last half, but in reality we want to treat all time gaps as equal relative to the length of the time gap. So we can normalize all timestamps as 0 to 1 (0 is earliest to 1 as latest) or the inverse 1 to 0 (1 is earliest). In this way, we calculate two points, draw a line from earliest to latest to know the direction the neutrino is going, then (**IMPORTANT**) flip it to answer the organizer's stated question of where did the neutrino come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 'charge' instead of mass, we can trivially calculate the 'center of charge' of an arbitrary number of points. The time weights just become another weighting besides charge in this very simple algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If v_i is each observation's x,y,z coordinates, and t0_i (t1_i) is the calculated time weights, then simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python3\n",
    "v0 = sum(v_i * charge_i * t0_i) / sum(charge_i * t0_i)\n",
    "v1 = sum(v_i * charge_i * t1_i) / sum(charge_i * t1_i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which can also be expressed in the form as simply sum(w * v) / sum(w), for arbitrary weights, which in our case we are using dual time-weights: w0 = charge * t0; w1 = charge * t1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from that, v1 - v0 is the direction vector, with the reverse (v0 - v1) being the direction the neutrino is from."

So I simplified to simply using vertical neighbors and seeing how many is optimal. And likewise tuning how far apart to set the optimal max time delta. 1000ns is probably too long, if you are mainly using adjacent sensors that logically SHOULD both trigger for the high energy events you are looking for.\n",
